// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Pseudocode:
 declare variable called number
 if remainder of number%2 is 0, number is even
      else number is odd


Possible code:
int number = 0;

if (number%2 == 0)
   print ("Even Number", number);
else 
   print ("Odd Number", number);



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

int largest = 0
int counter = 0
int input number = user input

for counter = 1 to 5
{
  get input number 
  if largest >= input number
   no action
  else if largest < input number
   largest = input number 
}

print largest;
